 stmu_europe.2.n:0 "A Royal Marriage"
 stmu_europe.2.d:0 "King Ferdinand II of Aragon was married to the princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid on October 19, 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. \n\nThe marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. Many considered Ferdinand the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them. Machiavelli attributed to him the objectionable qualities of the Renaissance prince.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 2"

 stmu_europe.5.d:0 "PEACE HAS ITS COST!/n/nOur war with England began when we were invaded by an army of over 16,000 troops by King Edward IV of England, who made an alliance with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Due to our lack of preparations, we were forced to settle for a peace treaty in order to protect our country./n/nThe cause of this invasion was that after the signing of the Treaty of London in 1474, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, agreed to help England by invading France. After being invaded, our King Louis XI sent King Edward an offer that would be better than those of his other allies./n/nOn this August 29th, the Treaty of Picquigny has been established! Our King Louis XI and King Edward IV have agreed to:/na seven-year truce,/nfree commercial exchange between the two countries,/nan arranged marriage between Prince Charles, the dauphin, and Princess Elizabeth of York,/n daughter of Edward IV,/n  regular payments of 50,000 gold crowns per year,and a one-time payment of 75,000 gold crowns in return for England withdrawing its troops./n/nThe Kings have agreed to assist each other against foreign enemies or rebellious acts.

 stmu_europe.6.n:0 "The Fifty-Year Anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt"
 stmu_europe.6.d:0 "Fifty years ago today our great kingdom suffered a humiliating loss to the English army at the Battle of Agincourt. The English used their terrain and longbows to cripple our cavalry and snub their charges, sending our panicked horses back disrupting our battle lines. Their longbows proved useful in slowing the advance of our knights and causing exhaustion and injury in our ranks. Their rabble of an army proved to be surprisingly formidable even when their bows ran out of arrows, their fierceness was amplified by our warriors' exhaustion. Their use of the terrain made our number irrelevant and soon our army was being beaten back and routed. By the end of the battle a large portion of our soldiers had been captured or killed; in all we lost around 8000 loyal servants to the throne that day. Though we were humbled by the outcome of this battle, we were also wizened. We have learned from our mistakes and we are stronger for it. For the sake of the fallen of Agincourt and all of France, we shall prevail and overcome any form of adversity that comes our way.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 6"
