 stmu_europe.2.n:0 "A Royal Marriage"
 stmu_europe.2.d:0 "§YKing Ferdinand II of Aragon§!, was married to the princess §YIsabella of Castile§! in Valladolid on October 19, 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. \n\nThe marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. Many considered Ferdinand the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them. Machiavelli attributed to him the objectionable qualities of the Renaissance prince."\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 2"
