 stmu_europe.2.n:0 "A Royal Marriage"
 stmu_europe.2.d:0 "King Ferdinand II of Aragon was married to the princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid on October 19, 1469. This was a marriage of political opportunism, not romance. The court of Aragon dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed help to gain succession to the throne. \n\nThe marriage initiated a dark and troubled life, in which Ferdinand fought on the Castilian and Aragonese fronts in order to impose his authority over the noble oligarchies, shifting his basis of support from one kingdom to the other according to the intensity of the danger. Despite the political nature of the union, he loved Isabella sincerely. Many considered Ferdinand the savior of his kingdoms, a bringer of unity. Others despised him for having oppressed them. Machiavelli attributed to him the objectionable qualities of the Renaissance prince.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 2"

 stmu_europe.5.d:0 "PEACE HAS ITS COST!\n\nOur war with England began when we were invaded by an army of over 16,000 troops by King Edward IV of England, who made an alliance with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Due to our lack of preparations, we were forced to settle for a peace treaty in order to protect our country.\n\nThe cause of this invasion was that after the signing of the Treaty of London in 1474, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, agreed to help England by invading France. After being invaded, our King Louis XI sent King Edward an offer that would be better than those of his other allies.\n\nOn this August 29th, the Treaty of Picquigny has been established! Our King Louis XI and King Edward IV have agreed to:\n*a seven-year truce,\n*free commercial exchange between the two countries,\n*an arranged marriage between Prince Charles, the dauphin, and Princess Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV,\n*regular payments of 50,000 gold crowns per year, and a one-time payment of 75,000 gold crowns in return for England withdrawing its troops.\n\nThe Kings have agreed to assist each other against foreign enemies or rebellious acts. Lastly, in order to discuss issues and compromise, the committee will meet annually, and the decisions will be binding.

 stmu_europe.6.n:0 "The Fifty-Year Anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt"
 stmu_europe.6.d:0 "Fifty years ago today our great kingdom suffered a humiliating loss to the English army at the Battle of Agincourt. The English used their terrain and longbows to cripple our cavalry and snub their charges, sending our panicked horses back disrupting our battle lines. Their longbows proved useful in slowing the advance of our knights and causing exhaustion and injury in our ranks. Their rabble of an army proved to be surprisingly formidable even when their bows ran out of arrows, their fierceness was amplified by our warriors' exhaustion. Their use of the terrain made our number irrelevant and soon our army was being beaten back and routed. By the end of the battle a large portion of our soldiers had been captured or killed; in all we lost around 8000 loyal servants to the throne that day. Though we were humbled by the outcome of this battle, we were also wizened. We have learned from our mistakes and we are stronger for it. For the sake of the fallen of Agincourt and all of France, we shall prevail and overcome any form of adversity that comes our way.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 6"

 stmu_europe.7.d:0 "After long days of arduous combat, our brave warriors, commanded by Sultan Mehmed II “the Conqueror,” have fulfilled the prophecy of our ancestors take Constantinople once and for all. As the battle approached its finale, the last wave, consisting of our elite army, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the land troops, Giovanni Giustiniani, was grievously wounded during our attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders. The walls of the golden city could not stop the heroic determination of our army, and in a matter of days, the most renowned Byzantium characters succumbed to our ferocity. Our flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, and panic ensued. Their defenses collapsed, as our soldiers, led by Hasan of Ulubat, pressed forward. Constantine, knowing that the city was doomed, tore the imperial insignia from his uniform and led his men in one last futile charge, dying in the streets with his soldiers. The civilians barricaded themselves in the Hagia Sophia, the greatest church in the city, hoping for divine protection. The day has come when stubborn heretics bow their heads to the greatness of Sultan Mehmed II.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 7"

 stmu_europe.13.d:0 "Hurrah, the Protestant Reformation begins!\n\nIn 1521, at the Diet of Worms, a decree was announced to the public, that any and all individuals who practice or follow the teachings of Martin Luther are condemned by the Holy Roman Empire. Martin Luther himself was also banished and exiled. This proclamation of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V has since created religious unrest between the Catholics of the Empire and a growing number of Lutheran supporters calling themselves reformers. Among those reformers were a number of powerful German princes, especially John, Elector of Saxony and Philip of Hesse.\n\nThe First Diet of Speyer took place in 1526. At the direction of Emperor Charles V, the Edict of Worms was to be upheld and strengthened. But the Emperor was not able to attend the Diet, which allowed the reformer princes to have the Diet of Worms suspended, and announced that every prince should believe what he could justify before his King and his God. This gave the reformers a temporary victory over the repressive measures of the Emperor and the Catholic orthodoxy.\n\nOn the 19th of April 1529, the Second Diet of Speyer pronounced the complete revocation of the 1526 Edict, which had temporarily suspended the Edict of Worms. The Lutheran princes refused to accept the decree. The following day, the reformers drew up a 'Letter of Protestation,' which was presented to Archduke Ferdinand I, who refused to even have their letter read out loud. The Diet closed on April 24 with the Edict of Worms being upheld.\n\nOn the 25th of April, the six Lutheran princes and fourteen agents of the Imperial free cities drew up the 'Instrumentum Apellationis,' which restated the contents of their 'Letter of Protestation' and summarized their complaints about the decision of the Diet. This text was brought to the Holy Roman Emperor. This act of protest by these six Lutheran princes and fourteen Imperial free cities has earned them the name 'Protestants.' Hence the terms 'Protestant' and 'Protestantism,' and the label of their movement 'the Protestant Reformation.'

The Edict of Saint Germain of January 1562 was a royal decree that gave Huguenots the right to preach during the day only, and only in the countryside, and it also allowed protestant noblemen to run Huguenot churches on their estates. After a long reign of persecution by King Henry II, it did not end there. Francis would continue to persecute Huguenots during his reign.\n\nOn March 1, 1562, Francis and his men tried to force their way in and when the Huguenots responded by throwing rocks, Francis ordered fire after he was struck by a rock. His soldiers killed over sixty and injured more than one hundred Huguenots. In response to the massacre, the Huguenots called a synod in April, to ask Louis de Bourbon for aid through troops. Louis agreed and this was the start of the French Wars of Religion!\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n stmu europe 15"
